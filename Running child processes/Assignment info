Write a program that called 'loopcmp' that its implementation will not be limited in the number of comparison methods without the need to re-compile the program, 
The recieved comparison methods should be provided by the user (must provide an appropriate comparison execuatable).
The main loop of the program will perform the following actions:
1.Reading a pair of strings from stdin
2. When the standard input has reached the EOF, exit the loop.
3. Create a child process by executing the syscall 'fork'.
4. The child process should call the syscall 'execve' or 'execvp' for running the relevant comparison program.
B. The parent process must wait for the comparison to be completed by the child process, and the result of the comparison should be extracted by using the
macro WEXITSTATUS.
