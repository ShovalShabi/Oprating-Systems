Write a program that called primecount, the program will get a range of numbers (the default is the 1 to 100) and prints how many prime numbers are in the range.
Set the following options for user selection:
-u:upper value range.
-l:lower value range.
-n:maximum numbers to print that found in the range (g.e - if the range is 1 to 100 and the value of n is 5 then the program will print that there are 25 prime numbers,
but only five prime numbers must be printed (2,3,5,7,11) and not all of them.
-p:number of processes (not include the parent processes).
The procedure for finding prime numbers will be performed by several processes simultaneously or in parallel while sharing memory (array or any pointer), and the processes
will get distinct numbers to check g.e the parent process will wait untill the child processes will find every number that is in the range [l,u] the first process will,
start from l and will check any number by offset of p (which symbols the numbers of processes) so by that it will check the numbers: l, l+p, l+2p, l+3p..., same as the
first processes the second process will search for the numbers l+1,l+2p+1,l+3p+1..., and so on to every other process.
The parent process should only print the amount of the total prime numbers that the child processes found, and the actual numbers.
