Write a program that called primecount, the program will get a range of numbers (the default is the 1 to 100) and prints how many prime numbers are in the range.
Set the following options for user selection:
-u:upper value range.
-l:lower value range.
-n:maximum numbers to print that found in the range (g.e - if the range is 1 to 100 and the value of n is 5 then the program will print that there are 25 prime numbers,
but only five prime numbers must be printed (2,3,5,7,11) and not all of them.
-t:number of threads.
The procedure for finding prime numbers will be performed by several threads simultaneously or in parallel while maintaining the critical section safe from overloading
access by threads, there is no distinction for specific numbers that each thread can chack, each theard can  check any number.
The main thread will print out the amount of the total prime numbers that found by the other threads and will print them.
